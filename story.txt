A girl named Princess Priscilla liked a guy named Leon Sandcastle, but 
his parents want to arrange his marriage. They spent every waking moment 
with each other, but always in secret, away from Leon's parents. 
But one day they made a mistake and Priscilla accidently slept at Leon's 
house. Leon's parents never trusted Leon again. "What the about the NFL Draft
happening in 3 months? You must stay focused," his mother inquired. His 
response shook them...

"Yes, dear mother, I know it and I know that could change my life, but I am really serious about this relationship, because," he paused as if he had to make up his mind," because she is the princess and her power can help me make the team."
